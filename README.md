# Aragog
Ever wanted to build a bot that moves around by your command? Nah… not very interesting. Throw
in a few legs and make a crawling hexapod, how cool would that be? Maybe make it wireless -
controllable with your own phone. Now we’re talking!

This year Spider, the R&D club of NITT, presents to you μCon'19, workshop on ‘Aragog’, a Bio-
Inspired Spider Bot. Discover the world of microcontrollers, wireless communication, app-
development, and 3D kinematics. Make your own creepy-crawler with custom-built acrylic frames!
